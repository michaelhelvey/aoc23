# AOC 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Rust.

## Getting Started

You will need the [rust compiler](https://rustup.rs/) and the [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
command line task runner. (The command runner is optional but it's how I've structured things).

You can run the exercise for any given day by running `just day {num}`.
